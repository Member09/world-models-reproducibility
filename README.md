# World Models: Generative Physics Simulation 🧠
An implementation of the "World Models" architecture (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018) applied to a 2D physics environment. This system learns to "dream" the future states of a bouncing ball environment by compressing visual data into a latent space and modeling the dynamics over time.
